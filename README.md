Hammertime
======



---

Hammertime is an open-source Fork of Sledge which is an open-source Alternative to Valve's Hammer Editor for the Goldsource engine.
It is written in .NET and uses [Veldrid][2] for rendering, with DirectX 10.

Hammertime supports Goldsource mapping, and is constantly being updated to add more Features, some of these Features include:
- Prefab Support
- Model exporting (Like Propper)
- Dragging Brushes like in Hammer 5.2

Here are also some good Community Editors if you need some:
- [TrenchBroom](https://github.com/kduske/TrenchBroom) (TrenchBroom is very prominent in the Quake Mapping Community, it is used by some people for Half-Life mapping, but theres not a lot of people using it.)
- Valve Hammer Editor (Found in the steam Library which you get when you own Half Life 1)
- [JACK](http://jack.hlfx.ru/en/download.html) (Only get the paid Version if you want Steam Achivements.)

The Hammertime Editor is licensed under BSD-3.
